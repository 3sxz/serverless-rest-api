## 🛠️ Configuration

To make the serverless API work, you'll need to set up AWS services:

1. **AWS Lambda:**
   - Go to the AWS Management Console.
   - Navigate to the Lambda section.
   - Create a new function or use an existing one.

2. **API Gateway:**
   - In the console, go to the API Gateway section.
   - Create a new API and link it with your Lambda function.

3. **DynamoDB:**
   - Go to the DynamoDB console.
   - Create a new table to store your data. Make note of the table name and region; you'll need them for the configuration.

4. **Environment Variables:**
   - Set your AWS access keys and region in the application settings.

### 🔑 AWS Credentials

For the application to communicate with AWS services, you will need your AWS Access Key ID and Secret Access Key. Store them in a safe place.
